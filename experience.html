      For five semesters as an undergraduate, I worked in the Musculoskeletal and Quantitative Imaging Research (MQIR) lab under Dr. Galateia Kazakia at UCSF.  Upon graduating, she hired me as a full-time Staff Research Assistant II.  I provided data extraction and analysis on the porosity and density of radius and tibia bones from their High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) images. I also wrote and ran scripts in Perl and functions in MATLAB to streamline our analyses and execute image processing techniques such as baseline mapping and laminar analysis.  When I became a full-time employee, I was also in charge of training and assigning projects to a couple of new undergraduate researchers that joined the lab, as well as the new postdoctoral fellow that took over many of my resposibilities when I left.  I am so grateful for the incredible opportunities Dr. Kazakia entrusted to me, such as presenting our latest findings on our ongoing Type II Diabetes study at the UCSF Department of Radiology Symposium. Click <a id="ucsf-poster">here</a> to see the corresponding poster.  I am also honored to be a co-author on a number of papers, in various stages of publication.  For example, you can read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27154435">here</a> about how laminar analysis of bone revealed patterns in cortical porosity in Type II Diabetics.

      After my month-long course on Web Development in South Africa, I began to intern for a weekly meal ingredient delivery start-up, UCOOK.  This company already had a well-designed, well-functioning frontend, so in my four weeks I focused on making weekly backend tasks more efficient.  I created administrative pages, including an interface in which an admin can generate custom sticker labels for products and a page that parses an Excel spreadsheet containing menu details (ingredients, quantities, etc.) and then creates the corresponding menu object in the backend.

      During my time in college, I was a server with On Call! Hospitality Staffing company.  The two partners, Diane and Patti Rostaino, know that I graduated with a degree in Computer Science so they reached out to me when they needed advice on a client portal for their website.  Their website is built on WordPress and their needs were far more customized than potential plug-ins could provide so I wrote and designed a multi-page form in PHP for the client to enter their order details.

      In the wake of the 2016 election, a distraught Heide Miller gathered dozens of her friends and other concerned citizens to come together for a brainstorming session on crucial issues like healthcare, education, and the environment.  We broke into groups and came up with a lists of informational resources and local and national groups in need of money, volunteers, or other items.  Heide was considering a large shared GoogleDoc to disseminate the material we had come up with during the meeting, but I offered to create a website for the group instead.  This kicked off a months-long collaboration with Heide Miller, founder of Project Impact;  Martin Moorehouse, head of our regular newsletter; and Martine Freiberger, design and usability consultant.   The result is <a href="www.projectimpactbayarea.org">www.projectimpactbayarea.org</a>,  a website I designed and continue to maintain.
